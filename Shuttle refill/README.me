A guide for future descendants on how to refill this "fignyushka" (Shuttle).

##### Attention:

On picture WP_20170708_009 is shown where the thread should come out.
It should always come out from bottom as it is shown in the picture.
Otherwise motors that are intended to loosen threads will start to tighten them.
In that case weft yarn should be flipped 180 degrees and put in place again.
